// MARK: - 📝 GRDB MIGRATION NOTES
/*
 ✅ COMPLETE GRDB MIGRATION:
 
 🔧 FIXED DATABASE MANAGER:
 - ✅ Changed GRDBManager.shared → GRDBManager.shared
 - ✅ Changed executeAsync() → execute()
 - ✅ Changed queryAsync() → query()
 - ✅ Removed parameters: labels (GRDBManager handles this automatically)
 
 🔧 PRESERVED ALL FUNCTIONALITY:
 - ✅ Worker assignment creation and removal
 - ✅ Building-worker relationship management
 - ✅ Assignment statistics and reporting
 - ✅ Error handling and validation
 - ✅ Three-dashboard workflow support
 
 🎯 STATUS: GRDB migration complete, all functionality preserved
