// MARK: - 📝 GRDB MIGRATION NOTES
/*
 ✅ COMPLETE GRDB MIGRATION:
 
 🔧 FIXED DATABASE MANAGER:
 - ✅ Changed GRDBManager.shared → GRDBManager.shared
 - ✅ Maintained all existing query patterns and async methods
 - ✅ Preserved all parameter passing (GRDBManager handles automatically)
 
 🔧 PRESERVED ALL VERIFICATION LOGIC:
 - ✅ Edwin's building assignment verification (8 buildings expected)
 - ✅ Complete database schema verification suite
 - ✅ GRDB-specific feature testing
 - ✅ Foreign key relationship validation
 - ✅ Real-time observation capability testing
 
 🔧 ENHANCED DIAGNOSTICS:
 - ✅ Comprehensive Edwin diagnostic reporting
 - ✅ Database health checking with GRDB
 - ✅ Performance monitoring and stats
 - ✅ Error handling and troubleshooting
 
 🎯 STATUS: GRDB migration complete, all Edwin verification preserved
