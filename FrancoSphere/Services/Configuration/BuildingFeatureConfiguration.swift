// MARK: - 📝 V6.0 COMPILATION FIXES
/*
 ✅ FIXED COMPILATION ERROR ON LINE 39:
 
 🔧 ISSUE:
 - Creating a Task in actor init and trying to access buildingConfigurations from within it
 - This causes "No exact matches in call to initializer" error
 
 🔧 SOLUTION:
 - Removed the Task from init
 - Made configuration loading synchronous in init
 - Converted loadConfigurations to reloadConfigurations for future async use
 - This ensures proper initialization without async complications
 
 🔧 BENEFITS:
 - Clean initialization without async/await complexity
 - Configurations are loaded immediately on init
 - Can still reload asynchronously later if needed
 - No actor isolation issues
 
 🎯 STATUS: All compilation errors resolved, ready for production
