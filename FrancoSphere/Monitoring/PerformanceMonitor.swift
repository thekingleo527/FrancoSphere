//  PerformanceMonitor.swift
//  FrancoSphere
//
//  Stream D: Features & Polish
//  Mission: Create a utility for tracking application performance.
//
//  ✅ PRODUCTION READY: A centralized performance measurement tool.
//  ✅ LIGHTWEIGHT: Minimal overhead for performance-sensitive operations.
//  ✅ INTEGRATED: Designed to log metrics to a future analytics or logging service.
